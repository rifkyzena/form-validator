# form-validator
A form validation website to test my skills on building a secure form on the front-end side. This form will validate multiple inputs from e-mail to password with complexity requirements with the help of Regex.  

## How it works:
![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) `WARNING: THIS WEBSITE IS BEST ACCESSED ON CHROME`

There are 6 fields on this form you need to fill:

1. Full Name Input:
The constraints I have set on this one is that you need to input at least 3 characters and no more than 100 characters.

2. Phone Number Input:
The constraints I have set on this one is that you can only type numbers. The number string are divided by 3, separated by two dashes.

3. Email Address Input:
The constraints I have set on this one is that you need to input a valid email with '@' symbol and .com at the end your answer.

4. Website URL:
The constraints I have set on this one is that whatever website you are about to type in, please include 'https://' at the beginning.

5. Password and Confirm Password:
This one was a bit tricky to set up the required pattern. Basically you will need to include at least 1 uppercase character, 1 lowercase character, and 1 number on your input.

**The message box below the register button will change accordingly depending if you have successfully entered every query or if you did a specific mistake.**
